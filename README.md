## Machine Learning Music Genre Classifier Project

This model was trained with a dataset of over 200,000 songs from Spotify, 24 genres, and 15 audio analysis features (ex. acousticness, danceability, energy, loudness).  The song you input is retrieved using the Spotify API, then run through the model.
